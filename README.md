# ButtonGame
Try to turn all the buttons white or all the buttons black

## Requirements
python 3

## Instructions
Run the script with python in a terminal or IDE. Once the window is open use the mouse cursor to select any of the buttons. The button you select will flip from black to white or white to black. Additionally other buttons will flip as well. Each time you click a new shape of buttons will be fipped and you can see the current shape by the shadow under the cursor. Try and change all the buttons to one color! Or change half to black and half to white, top to bottom or left to right!

You can save your progress or open an existing game from a .json file with a list of all the black buttons. (Sample games available within this repository)
