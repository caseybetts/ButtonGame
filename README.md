# ButtonGame
This started as an excercise in creating buttons in the Tkinter modual, but turns out to be a pretty fun game. The objective is to simply change all the tiles black or all white. 

## Requirements
- python 3
- tkinter

## Instructions
Run the script with python in a terminal or IDE. Once the window is open use the mouse cursor to select any of the tiles. The tile you select will change color. Additionally other tiles will change as well. Which other tiles change will depend on the active shape. The active shape will change with each click. You can see the current shape by the shadow under the cursor. Try and change all the buttons to one color! Or change half to black and half to white, top to bottom or left to right!

You can save your progress or open an existing game from a .json file with a list of all the black buttons. (Sample games available within this repository)
